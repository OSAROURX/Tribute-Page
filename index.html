        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Albert Einstein was an incredibly clever man with a very enquiring
          mind. Most people would agree that he remains the most famous and
          talented scientist ever to have lived. All those discoveries he made
          years ago still help us understand our universe and the events that
          happen in it today. Einstein showed great promise from an early age –
          although he apparently wasn’t keen on school! At just 5 years old he
          became intrigued by a compass his father had bought him, trying to
          work out just why the needle always pointed north. Einstein got a job
          checking out other people’s inventions because he couldn’t find work
          as a teacher but at the same time he was working on his own scientific
          ideas. He came up with some amazing theories about light, matter,
          gravity, space, and time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group of papers he wrote while working at the Patent Office in
          Bern showed just what a great scientific thinker Einstein was. He
          discovered new ways to work out the size of molecules, explained how
          particles move and made new discoveries about light. Einstein probably
          remains most famous for his ‘theory of relativity’ and perhaps the
          most famous mathematical equation ever written, E = mc² – which means
          Energy (e) equals mass (m) times the speed of light, squared (c²). His
          theory is even difficult for grown-ups to fully understand! But the
          equation shows that mass can be turned into energy and vice versa.
          Because the speed of light squared is such a huge number, it means
          that even a small amount of mass can be turned into a huge amount of
          energy!
        </p>
        <p>
          Albert Einstein died at the age of 76 from heart failure on 18 April
          1955. He had hoped to pull all his ideas together into one big theory
          before he died but he didn’t achieve that goal. After he died,
          Einstein’s brain was removed and preserved and research was carried
          out on it to see if there was a reason for his genius!
